# Assignment from 28th August 2017

1. Add methods ``product`` to the class ComplexNumber
provided in ``code.py``. Please make sure you have docstrings for all functions
and methods

2. Add an in-place method ``complex_conjugate``, which does not return anything,
but replaces the instance by its complex conjugate.

3. Add a method called ``polar_coordinates`` to ``NonZeroComplexNumber`` to return
the polar coordinates. Use it to define a method called ``logarithm`` which gives 
the principal branch of the log.

**Do not use built-in methods of python for this. Docstrings are mandatory.**
